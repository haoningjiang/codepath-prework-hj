## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Plan for App: 
I want to create an inventory app that lets users track the contents of their fridges. Users will enter their groceries, leftovers, and other food items into the app when they place said items in their fridge; the app will track when said item was entered and change the entry color when it has been in the fridge for too long. Thus, users will be able to see on the app what they have in their fridges and what items might be expiring soon. 

## Notes

I couldn't download XCode from the App Store, so I had to download it from the developer website instead.
